## {$page.title}

T.apex has a dependency on [R.apex](https://github.com/Click-to-Cloud/R.apex).

First, we will include R.apex.

Include **Func.cls**, **R.cls**, and **RTest.cls**(optional) into your Org, and R.apex is ready.

Then, we will include T.apex.

Include **Random.cls**, **T.cls**, and **TTest.cls**(optional) into your Org, and you are ready to go.
